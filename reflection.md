The classmates I worked with on this assignment were Dakota Law, Raley Long, Sarah Mian, and Glenvelis Perez.
I attended TA Hours on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday and Office Hours on Tuesday. 
So far my initial impressions of Java have been mixed, I'm really trying to get out of the Python mindset, especially when it comes to formatting. The indents vs new lines vs curly brackets is something I'm finding particularly difficult. A conclusion I can draw about programming is that many languages have a lot of similarities, and this is something I noticed when moving from Python to R as well. But when switching to a new language, even though there are similarities, it can be hard to switch your mindset because of your knowledge and experience in your prior languages. But using what you know and applying it in different contexts, and just taking things one step at a time really helps. Going step by step and just trying to implement one thing at a time really worked for me, because I was able to just focus on one task instead of getting overwhelmed with making this entire program to do multiple things. Advice I would give for students in the future is to do this. Making pseudo code to plan out the steps can help a lot. Another piece of advice I'd give it to take advantage of you peers through working with people like the professors, TAs, and other classmates. They can give you advice or hints, but also just talking it through sometimes can help you figure things out on your own as well.
